\chapter{System Identification}
\label{systemIdentification}

In this chapter, is going to be address an important part of this project. Since the model of the previous chapter is depending from many parameters, is necessary to identificate them, to be able to design an appropriate controller. A Kalman Filter approach will be used, based from the work \cite{modelIdentification}.
